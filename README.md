Dracker is a simple application written in PHP, used to do some basic tracking of MS Word documents. It is possible to use Dracker to:

    - Track sensitive documents within your organisation (or externally depends where you setup it up)
    - Create "honey pot" documents that should never be opened, placed in sensitive shares

# Installation #
################

1. Place contents of the dracker folder in the webroot, example:
	
	/var/www/dracker/
	
2. Create a database for Dracker within MySQL. Import the Dracker MySQL dump to create the database:

	>mysql -u <dbuser> -p dracker < dracker.sql

3. Configure the Dracker PHP Database connection to reflect your mysql account details, located under (example):

	/var/www/dracker/configs/DatabaseConnection.php

   There is also another file under the /configs/ directory, EncryptionKey.php. Edit the key before you begin using Dracker. Its really just used to encrypt certain data within the database.

If all went well you can browse to the newly setup web interface via your browser. The default admin account to login with is:

	User: admin
	Pwd:  admin (Please reset the account immediately)

Enjoy
